## Issues

Derpy is very commonly used as an adjective to describe someone's clumsy or foolish behavior, often that of the speaker themselves. It is also used to describe someone else's physical features as unattractive or akin to someone with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In imagery derpy is often signified by crossed eyes, a stuck out tongue, or facial deformities. 

## Impact

By using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental or physical disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.

## Usage Tip

Be more specific. Typically we can find an alternate definition by taking time to reflect on what emotion we're really feeling.
