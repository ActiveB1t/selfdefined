## Issues

Derpy is very commonly used as an adjective to describe someone's clumsy or foolish behavior, often that of the speaker themselves. It is also used to describe someone else's physical features as unattractive or akin to someone with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In imagery derpy is often signified by crossed eyes, a stuck out tongue, or facial deformities. 
## Origins
The word "derp" [allegedly comes "Mr Derp"](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Derp) from the American animated sitcom, __South Park__. The creators of the show have expressed that Mr Derp came from a word they invented where something was "an obvious joke."

The word evolved in 4chan and other forums and began being associated with memes, where the "derpy" imagery began. It is there where it became associated with intellectual and development disabilities specifically, as people started overlaying "derp" over photographs of children with I/DD.
## Impact

By using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental or physical disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.

## Usage Tip

Be more specific. Typically we can find an alternate definition by taking time to reflect on what emotion we're really feeling.
